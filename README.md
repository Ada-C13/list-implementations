# Practice Together
Together we will
  - talk about native arrays vs. Ruby arrays (`ArrayList` in Java)
  - write `lib/array_list.rb` where we will simulate what happens "under the hood" with Ruby's Array object.
      - together: `initialize`, `add`, `delete`, `to_s`, `include?`, `size`
      - on your own: `max`
  - Then we will take a look at `lib/linked_list.rb` and see how the _implementation_ is different (but the _interface_ is the same) and uses nodes instead of a native array to store data.
      - provided: `Node` class, `LinkedList` class: `initialize`, `add`, `delete`, `to_s`
      - together: `include?`
      - on your own: `size`, `max`
